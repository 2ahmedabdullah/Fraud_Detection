## Fraud_Detection Overview

Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning is a process of data investigation by a Data Science team and the development of a model that will provide the best results in revealing and preventing fraudulent transactions. 
We will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud.

## Goals

Create a Neural Network and compare the accuracy to our best classifier.
Understand common mistakes made with imbalanced datasets.
